Summarise your findings here (see specification).

Extremely Hard
File: mystery1.dat
Reason: By visual inspection, the board contains the least amount of numbers and therfore would require more time/logic to solve by a human
        Additionally,the board solver function recursed on itself 421546 times to solve the board which was signifacntly larger than for mystery3.dat

Hard
File: mystery3.dat
Reason: The board solver function recursed on itself 25665 times to solve the board which was just over half the number of times it took to solve myster1.dat.
        Addtioanlly the board by visual inspection contains more numbers to start off with and therfore would require less time/logic to solve by a human.

Not Solvable
File: mystery2.dat
Reason: The solver function returned false for the myster2.dat file and therefore as I used a brute force method of trying every possible number in every possible cell and it still failed the board cannot be solved.
